This utility is designed to check that the size of the FIFOs
written in the board's EEPROM matches the size of the FIFOs
physically installed on the PowerDAQ board.

If a difference is found, FifoFix updates the board's EEPROM
with the true FIFO size.

If FifoFix reports a problem and fixes the EEPROM, you need
to unload and reload the PowerDAQ kernel module so that it
can refresh its internal parameters with the updated EEPROM.
