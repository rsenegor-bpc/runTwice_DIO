3.6.8 Added support for RTLinuxPro 2.x
3.6.7 Added support for sysfs and udev to dynamically create device nodes 
      in /dev when the driver is loaded
3.6.6 Added support for Real-time Bus master mode (for XPCMOD boards)
      Fixed compile error with kernel version > 2.6.10
3.6.5 Added support for RTAI under kernel 2.6. Firmware update.
      Added support for short-burst bus master transfers
3.6.4 Firmware update.
3.6.3 Fixed immediate update bug. Firmware update.
3.6.2 Fixed bug with simultaneous update on PD2-AO32 boards
3.6.1 Fixed race condition when calling interruptible_sleep()..
3.6   Added support for AMD64 processors
3.5.1 Fixed issues with Fedora Core2. Added example BufferedAI_Async
      Added support for 3MHz Multifunction boards
3.5   Added support for kernel 2.6.x. Added examples BufferedAI_Multiboards, BufferedAIAO
3.4   Added support for PD2-DIOxx-TS boards.
3.3   Fixed bugs with SMP computers and computers with more than 1Gb of memory
3.1   Added support for Bus Master data transfer.
3.0   Added support for buffered AO,DI,DO and UCT. Added support for buffered I/O 
      under RTLinux and RTAI. Added support for PowerDAQ Lab boards.
      Added examples : BufferedDI, BufferedDO
2.0   Added LabVIEW support and added examples : SingleDI, SingleDO,
      UCTDSP, UCT
1.3   Added support for  Kylix, added examples : SingleAI, SingleAO
      BufferedAI, BufferedAO
1.2   Added support for kernel 2.4.x
1.1.2 Two examples added: Stream2 strams data from analog input to disk file,
      rtl_int_ai shows how to process AIn interrupts under RTLinux.
      When you compile driver with _PD_RT it doesn't request interrupts from
      Linux. We also tested driver with Suse 7.1 (kernel 2.4.6).
1.1   New hardware supported, new firmware improves performance,
      PdImmediateUpdate bug fixed
      See pdfw_if.h for the new functions added (PD2-AO-xx and PD2-DIO-xx)
1.0   Driver module name is changed to pwrdaq.o to satisfy RedHat users
      PdAcquireSubsystem() fixed, _PdWaitForEvent() added - now you don't need
      to process SIGIO event. In Async mode you can use WaitForEvent or
      simple blocked read/write
      StreamW example added uses this function
      tt.c example shows how to use threads in Linux
0.9   XFer fixed, access to DSP registers added
0.87  Buffering mechanism was changed. Now big chunk of memory can be distributed
      in the kernel space. Then, user-level library mmap() this chunk of memory
      into user space for share use. PowerDAQ API manual is written and added
      to the installation. All available at the user/kernal level functions are
      clearly commented. Library powerdaq32.c could be compiled to use in the
      user space or in the kernel space with RT modules.
0.86  conditional compilation for RT-Linux added. Note: all memory allocation and
      memory copying functions are moved to the powerdaq.c from the library.
      Library is done fully OS-independent. Please see changes in compilation
      procedure
0.85  AO32 fixed
0.84  PdAInGetSamples and PDAOutPutBlock fixed. PD-DIO FIFO size fixed
0.83: GetScans now can return raw data or voltages. AIn async mode broken since
      0.81 is fixed.
0.82: All user-space access functions are moved out of kernel-dependent part.
      You no longer need to recompile library to use with RT-Linux
0.81: Driver is split into kernel-dependent and kernel-independent parts
